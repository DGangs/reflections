When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  Remote would be used if you need to backup, share, or collaborate with a team on your code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    To only share changes that are stable or complete with others.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    branch: is for experimenting or starting new code on any repository.
    clones: are for making working copies of a repository to share or work on.
    forks: are on GitHub only for copying repository and then building unique code ontop of the fork.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To compare changes from the remote before merging.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Collaborating without Git/GitHub, you would have to manage communicating all updates and request
     to copy code between team members. With Git you need to communicate pull requests and manually execute
     them outside of Git.  GitHub handles the communication aspects.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    A separate branch allows you to experiment and make changes without impacting others.  Enables peer
     review to happen before merging.
